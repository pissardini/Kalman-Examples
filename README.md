# Kalman-Examples
This is a step-by-step code for understanding Discrete Kalman Filters that I used for the Computer Science classes I taught. The goal is not to provide an optimal code, but to provide an understanding of how the process works.

The recommended order for analysis is:

* kalman_simple_1D.py
* kalman_simple_1D_iterations.py
* kalman_simple_1D_loop.py
* observation_matrix_example.py
* prediction_step_example.py
* state_matrix_example.py
* complete_kalman_example.py
